# GPU Playground

This is my personal collection of examples, code-snippets and algorithm implementations related to graphics and GPU programming in general. I use this repository for prototyping, quick reference, code sharing, and as a resource for my articles on the topic.

The examples labeled with a _minimal_ suffix are expected to be the minimum possible (but readable) code to achieve a particular goal. These are not intended to be complete or functional, but just provide the highest signal vs. noise ratio, with minimum boilerplate and dependencies. They are, in a way, the examples I wish existed when I started looking into the thing.

All examples are written in standard C99, unless not possible for some practical reason.

Have fun!
